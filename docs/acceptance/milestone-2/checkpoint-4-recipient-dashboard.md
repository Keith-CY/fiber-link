# M2 Checkpoint 4: Recipient Dashboard (Balance + Tip History)

## Goal

Provide recipient-facing dashboard visibility for balance and tip history.

## Collected evidence

- Scope requirement:
  - `docs/01-scope-mvp.md` (creator dashboard includes balance + tip history)
- Progress references:
  - `docs/06-development-progress.md` (plugin tip UI documented; dashboard completion not stated as final)
- Open optional dashboard follow-ups in tracker:
  - GitHub issues `#39`, `#45`

## Current status

`PARTIAL`

Dashboard is part of scope, but current progress docs emphasize tip modal path and do not provide final acceptance evidence for full recipient dashboard behavior.

## Exit criteria

- Dashboard page shows recipient balance and tip history in testnet demo.
- Acceptance evidence includes at least one reproducible dashboard verification run.
