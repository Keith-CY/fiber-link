# M1 Checkpoint 6: Acceptance Criteria Gate

## Criteria

- public repo
- documented setup
- demo video or live testnet demo

## Collected evidence

- Public repository baseline and docs index:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/README.md`
- Setup documentation:
  - `docs/admin-installation.md`
  - `docs/runbooks/testnet-bootstrap.md`
  - `docs/runbooks/compose-reference.md`
- Public proof tracking issue:
  - [#114](https://github.com/Keith-CY/fiber-link/issues/114)

## Current status

`PARTIAL`

- Public repo: satisfied.
- Documented setup: satisfied.
- Demo video/live testnet demo proof: tracked externally in issue `#114` and still requires final acceptance evidence update.

## Exit criteria

- `#114` includes final demo proof link (video or live testnet record).
- Milestone 1 index and proof links are consistent across docs.
