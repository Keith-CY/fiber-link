# M3 Checkpoint 3: Production Hardening

## Goal

Close production hardening items for monitoring, rate limiting, backups, and docs polish.

## Collected evidence

- Security assumptions and owner matrix:
  - `docs/runbooks/security-assumptions.md`
- Security controls to evidence mapping:
  - `docs/runbooks/security-controls-evidence-map.md`
- Threat-model checklist and sign-off guidance:
  - `docs/runbooks/threat-model-evidence-checklist.md`
- Deployment evidence capture and retention policy:
  - `docs/runbooks/deployment-evidence.md`
  - `docs/runbooks/evidence-template/deployment/retention-policy.md`
- Remaining hardening notes:
  - `docs/06-development-progress.md`

## Current status

`PARTIAL`

Hardening controls are documented with verification pathways, but not all production policy controls are marked complete in roadmap/progress docs.

## Exit criteria

- Monitoring and alerting controls are explicitly verified in release evidence.
- Rate limiting and backup/recovery procedures are validated and linked.
- Documentation is internally consistent and release-ready.
