Define and complete a dedicated mainnet deployment readiness checklist.

## Collected evidence

  - `docs/runbooks/compose-reference.md`
  - `docs/runbooks/testnet-bootstrap.md`
- Deployment evidence packaging baseline:
  - `docs/runbooks/deployment-evidence.md`

## Current status

`PENDING`

Existing runbooks focus on local/staging and testnet validation. A dedicated mainnet checklist is not yet published.

## Exit criteria

- Mainnet-specific preflight checklist exists and is linked from docs index.
- Checklist includes environment hardening, key management, rollback, and post-deploy verification steps.
