# M3 Checkpoint 5: Acceptance Criteria Gate

## Criteria

- mainnet-ready release
- full docs
- demo instance

## Collected evidence

- Current post-phase roadmap and remaining items:
  - `docs/06-development-progress.md`
  - `docs/04-research-plan.md`
- Security and deployment evidence baselines:
  - `docs/runbooks/security-assumptions.md`
  - `docs/runbooks/deployment-evidence.md`

## Current status

`PENDING`

The repository has substantial baseline controls and runbooks, but mainnet-ready release artifacts and final acceptance demo evidence are not yet documented as complete.

## Exit criteria

- Release package is marked mainnet-ready with sign-off.
- Full docs set is updated and consistent with runtime behavior.
- Mainnet demo instance (or equivalent production proof) is linked from acceptance index.
