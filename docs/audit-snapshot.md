This branch has not recorded a generated run yet.

The generator writes one of two shapes:

- Full summary mode:
  - `docs_superseded`, `docs_todo`, `core_todo`, `test_files` with signed deltas
  - TODO/FIXME hit details (`path`, `line`, `token`) with truncation (`+N more`)
  - test-file added/removed path lists and deterministic set hashes
  - dirty-tree diagnostics (`dirty_count`, `dirty_fingerprint`, representative paths)
- Compact no-change mode:
  - used when run-to-run metric deltas are all zero
  - keeps output minimal to reduce noise
