## Scope
- Repository:   - Keith-CY/fiber-link
- Default branch:   - main

## Source-of-truth policy
- Use this document as canonical architecture index.
- Any superseded/diverged plan doc must link here.
- New architectural decisions should be reflected here first.

## Next cleanup actions
1. Link all superseded/diverged docs to relevant canonical sections.
2. Replace unresolved TODO/TBD/FIXME markers with tracked issues.
3. Keep this index updated in each architecture-changing PR.
